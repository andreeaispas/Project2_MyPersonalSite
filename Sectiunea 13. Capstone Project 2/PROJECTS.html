        <li><b>CISCO Networking 1 and 2:</b> They were intended to configure the initial settings on a piece of
            equipment available for a small or mediumâ€‘sized business network. I took the courses
            throughout year 2 out of a desire to learn about a different area of engineering than my own.

            my English and expanded my personal development. I stepped out of my comfort zone and
            learned to work under pressure and communicate strategically, working 2 jobs.</li>
